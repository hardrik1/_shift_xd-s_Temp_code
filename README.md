Hey lol 👋 This is a super chill Arduino project to help u sleep better (or like… at least make ur room beep until u finally give up 😂).

📦 Whats This?
Ok so:

A DHT11 sensorr to “feel” teh tempreature + humiditty 🌡️💧

A buzzer that beeps/chimes at u to tell:

✅ Room is perf for sleeping (chimes every 5 sec lol)

🔥 Almost perf (beepin like “yo go sleep asap”)

❌ Nope (no sound coz ur room is chaos rn)

Press button to shut it up when ur done 😅

🎯 Why???
Bc who tf wants to keep checkin their phone weather app at 2AM to see if it’s time to sleep?? Just let this thing scream at u 🤷‍♂️

⚡ Stuff u need
Part	Why tho
Arduino UNO	Brainz of teh thing 🧠
DHT11 Sensor	Feels room vibes 🌡️
Buzzer	So it can annoy u 🔊
Button	Ur savior button 🖲️ (mute it ASAP lol)

🛠️ How 2 Use
🪛 Wire it up (google if confused ngl)

🔥 Flash da code w/ Arduino IDE

Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud lol)

Hear beeps? Close. Hear chimes? 💀 IT’S TIME 2 SLEEP

📖 Features (kinda cool ngl)
🎵 Chime every 5 sec in perf zone (22–24°C)

🔊 Short beep every 5 sec at exactly 25°C

🔔 Long 5sec beep at 20–21°C or 26°C

🔇 Press button → shuts da thing up lol

📟 Serial shows temp + humiditty like a lil dashboard

😂 Why Bother?
Bc:

u deserve 8hr sleep 💤

ur room deserves to sound like Star Wars ✨

and its lowkey funny watching it lose its mind at 25°C

💥 Demo??
idk maybe soon lol 🤷‍♀️

📜 Lisense
MIT. Go wild. But pls dont sue me if ur room turns into a rave 😂
